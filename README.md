**Last updated:** {{August 28, 2025}}

> This combined Terms & Privacy is written in plain language. It explains what you can expect from Echospectra and what we expect from you. If anything here conflicts with a signed order form or master agreement, the signed document controls.

## 1) Who owns the data

* **You own your case data** ("Customer Content"): photos, videos, maps, notes, logs, indicators, and exports you create or upload in Echospectra.
* We do **not** sell Customer Content or use it for advertising.

## 2) Our limited license to operate and improve the service

You grant Echospectra a **limited license** to host, process, back up, transmit, and secure Customer Content so the service works for you. You also allow us to use **de‑identified and aggregated** information derived from Customer Content to improve Echospectra, including:

* training and testing **internal** models that detect indicators (e.g., spalling) from images and field data;
* validating and improving **progression and dynamic fire‑behavior simulations**; and
* enhancing reliability, accuracy, and safety of our features.

**What “de‑identified and aggregated” means:** we remove or transform direct identifiers (e.g., names, case IDs, emails, exact addresses) and combine data across many customers so it cannot reasonably be tied back to a person, incident, or customer. We apply technical and organizational safeguards to prevent re‑identification.

**No cross‑matter advantage:** we will **not** use your case data to help an opposing party in the same matter, and we do not disclose insights specific to your case.

**No third‑party model training:** we do **not** use Customer Content to train third‑party models.

**Derived/Model artifacts:** models, analytics, and statistics we create from de‑identified/aggregated data are **Echospectra’s technology**. We will never expose them in a way that reveals your confidential content.

## 3) Processors and sharing (Option B)

* We do not disclose Customer Content to third parties **except** vetted **service providers** (processors) who help us run the service—e.g., cloud hosting, monitoring, secure storage, email delivery, and customer support tools. Processors act only on our instructions, must protect the data, and cannot use it for their own purposes.
* **Payments:** handled by **Stripe**. We do not store full card numbers; Stripe’s processing is governed by Stripe’s terms and privacy policy.
* **Legal requests:** we require valid legal process before disclosing any data and will notify you beforehand unless the law prohibits it.
* We never sell data and never share it for advertising.

## 4) Professional Services and conflicts

If you retain us to help analyze your data or prepare materials:

* We follow a strict **conflict protocol**: ethical walls, segregated workspaces, role‑based access, and audit logs.
* **No cross‑matter knowledge transfer.** If a wall cannot fully protect integrity, we may decline/withdraw from the engagement.
* You own your case data; we retain ownership of our background IP and tools. You receive a license to any templates/tooling we provide to you.

## 5) Security

* Encryption **in transit and at rest**, least‑privilege access, audit logging, vulnerability management, backups/DR, and incident response with notice where permitted.
* We follow **SOC 2 Type II** best practices; certification is **in progress**.

## 6) Acceptable use

* Don’t upload unlawful content, malware, or others’ confidential data without authorization. Don’t interfere with the service or attempt to access others’ data.

## 7) Usage data (no non‑essential toggle)

* We collect limited **usage and diagnostics** (e.g., performance, crash logs, feature usage counts) to operate, secure, and improve Echospectra. We do **not** currently offer a separate opt‑out toggle for non‑essential telemetry.

## 8) Your choices and controls

* **Access & export:** you can export your case data.
* **Deletion:** upon request or account closure, we delete active copies within **30 days** and purge backups on a rolling **90‑day** schedule.
* **Data residency:** if region options are offered, we’ll honor your selection.

## 9) Availability & support

* We strive for high uptime and may schedule maintenance. Support channels and response targets are published in our help materials.

## 10) Warranties, liability, and legal terms (short form)

* The service is provided **“as is”** to the extent allowed by law. We do not guarantee legal outcomes; you are responsible for investigative conclusions and filings.
* Our total liability is limited to the greater of **fees paid in the past 12 months** or **\$10,000**, excluding willful misconduct or breach of confidentiality.
* Governing law and venue are set in your order form or our standard terms.

## 11) Children

* Echospectra is not directed to children and is intended for professional use.

## 12) Changes

* If we make material changes, we’ll post an update and, where required, provide advance notice.
